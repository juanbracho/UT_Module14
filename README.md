# Module 14: Interactive Visualizations

## Overview
In this module, we explored how to use **Plotly**, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create interactive, attractive, and accessible data visualizations. We also integrated advanced JavaScript functionalities to build interactive dashboards and deployed polished visualizations to the web.

## Lessons Covered

### 14.1: Introduction to JavaScript Visualizations
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Storing and manipulating data using JavaScript variables, arrays, objects, and data types.
  - Implementing control flow in JavaScript (functions, loops, if/else statements).
  - Creating basic charts like bar charts and line charts using **Plotly**.
  - Customizing charts using Plotly’s layout options to add labels, text, and hover annotations.

### 14.2: Functional Programming for Data Processing
- **Topics Covered:**
  - JavaScript functional programming concepts.
  - Use of `.map()` and `.filter()` methods to preprocess and manipulate data for visualizations.
  - Writing ES6 arrow functions for streamlined and efficient code.
---

### 14.3: JavaScript with D3.js
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Using **D3.js** for advanced DOM manipulation and custom interactivity in visualizations.
  - Importing and parsing data from APIs using `d3.json`.
  - Creating interactive charts with dropdown menus, hover events, and dynamic updates using Plotly’s `restyle()` method.
  - Integrating metadata into visualizations by dynamically appending HTML elements.

- **Instructions Followed:**
  1. Imported data from `samples.json` using D3.js.
  2. Created a horizontal bar chart and bubble chart to display sample data.
  3. Updated all visualizations dynamically using dropdown menus.
  4. Added a demographic info panel to display metadata of selected samples.

## Final Project
The module culminated in building an interactive dashboard called the **Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard**. The dashboard includes:
- A dropdown menu to select datasets.
- Interactive bar and bubble charts displaying sample data.
- A metadata panel dynamically updated based on user interaction.
