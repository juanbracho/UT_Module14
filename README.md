# Module 14: Interactive Visualizations

## Overview
In this module, we explored how to use **Plotly**, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create interactive, attractive, and accessible data visualizations. We also integrated advanced JavaScript functionalities to build interactive dashboards and deployed polished visualizations to the web.

## Lessons Covered

### 14.1: Introduction to JavaScript Visualizations
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Storing and manipulating data using JavaScript variables, arrays, objects, and data types.
  - Implementing control flow in JavaScript (functions, loops, if/else statements).
  - Creating basic charts like bar charts and line charts using **Plotly**.
  - Customizing charts using Plotly’s layout options to add labels, text, and hover annotations.

---

### 14.2: Functional Programming for Data Processing
- **Topics Covered:**
  - JavaScript functional programming concepts.
  - Use of `.map()` and `.filter()` methods to preprocess and manipulate data for visualizations.
  - Writing ES6 arrow functions for streamlined and efficient code.

---

### 14.3: JavaScript with D3.js
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Using **D3.js** for advanced DOM manipulation and custom interactivity in visualizations.
  - Importing and parsing data from APIs using `d3.json`.
  - Creating interactive charts with dropdown menus, hover events, and dynamic updates using Plotly’s `restyle()` method.
  - Integrating metadata into visualizations by dynamically appending HTML elements.

## Final Project: Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

The culmination of this module was the creation of an interactive web-based dashboard to explore and visualize biological sample data. The project was structured to simulate a real-world data visualization scenario and required integrating various JavaScript skills. Key elements of the project included:

1. **Data Integration**:
   - Using D3.js to import biological sample data from a JSON file.
   - Parsing the JSON data and preparing it for visualizations.

2. **Visualizations**:
   - A **horizontal bar chart** displaying the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) found in a selected sample.
   - A **bubble chart** showing all bacterial species for the selected sample, where the marker size and color represented the sample values and OTU IDs, respectively.

3. **Interactive Features**:
   - A **dropdown menu** to dynamically select different biological samples and update all visualizations.
   - A **metadata panel** that displayed demographic information (e.g., age, location, gender) associated with the selected sample.

4. **User Experience**:
   - Integrated interactivity so users could explore the data and insights dynamically.
   - Ensured the dashboard was visually appealing and functional using Plotly for rendering and JavaScript for logic.
